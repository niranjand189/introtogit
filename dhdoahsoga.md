# What I learned 
## Repositories
It's where a project happens, kind of like a project folder that includes all the files of the project, I also learned that you can collaborate using repositories
## Cloning
I learned you can use to clone feature with repositories to prevent any difficulty with fixing issues, changing/removing/adding files, etc.
## Commiting and Pushing
I learned you can use the commit and push and include a little message describing any changes you made
## Some things I'm still confused about are:
- Forks
* Issues
+ Markdown
